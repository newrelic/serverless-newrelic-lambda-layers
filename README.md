# serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers

A [Serverless](https://serverless.com) plugin to add [New Relic](https://www.newrelic.com)
observability using [AWS Lambda Layers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html) without requiring a code change.

## Requirements

- [serverless](https://github.com/serverless/serverless) v3.x & v4.x (This plugin has been tested to work with Serverless Framework v3 & v4)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/) >= 14.x (if using Serverless version 3)

## Features

- Installs and configures the New Relic AWS Integration
- Supports Node.js, Python and Java runtimes (more runtimes to come)
- No code change required to enable New Relic
- Bundles New Relic's agent in a single layer
- Configures CloudWatch subscription filters automatically

## Install

With NPM:

```bash
npm install --save-dev serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers
```
(Note: this plugin's production dependencies are now defined as peer dependencies. NPM v7 and later will install missing peer dependencies automatically, but v6 does not.)

With yarn:

```bash
yarn add --dev serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers
```

Add the plugin to your `serverless.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  - serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers
```

This plugin should come last in your plugin ordering, particularly if you're also using plugins such as `serverless-plugin-typescript` or `serverless-webpack`.

If you don't yet have a New Relic account, [sign up here](https://newrelic.com/products/serverless-aws-lambda).

Grab your [New Relic Account ID](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id),
your [New Relic Personal API Key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys#personal-api-key)
and plug them into your `serverless.yml`:

```yaml
custom:
  newRelic:
    accountId: your-new-relic-account-id-here
    apiKey: your-new-relic-personal-api-key-here
```

Deploy:

```bash
sls deploy
```

And you're all set.

## Usage

This plugin wraps your handlers without requiring a code change. If you're currently
using a New Relic agent, you can remove the wrapping code you currently have and this plugin will
do it for you automatically.

- [Node.js Instrumentation Guide](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-nodejs#extend-instrumentation)
- [Python Instrumentation Guide](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/python-agent/custom-instrumentation/python-custom-instrumentation)
- [Java Instrumentation Guide](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/custom-instrumentation/java-custom-instrumentation)

## Config

The following config options are available via the `newRelic` section of the `custom` section of your `serverless.yml`:

#### `accountId` (required)

Your [New Relic Account ID](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id).

```yaml
custom:
  newRelic:
    accountId: your-account-id-here
```

#### `apiKey` (required)

Your [New Relic Personal API Key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys#personal-api-key).

```yaml
custom:
  newRelic:
    apiKey: your-api-key-here
```
If your function's source is committed to version control, you can avoid committing your license key by including it in your serverless.yml as a variable. See [the Serverless docs on template variables](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/variables/) for more information.  

#### `nrRegion` (required for EU; optional for US)

If your New Relic account is based in the EU, make sure to specify your nrRegion in the custom block:

```yaml
custom:
  newRelic:
    nrRegion: 'eu'
```

#### `linkedAccount` (optional)

A label for the New Relic Linked Account. This is how this integration will
appear in New Relic. If not set, it will default to "New Relic Lambda Integration - 
<AWS ACcount ID>".

```yaml
custom:
  newRelic:
    linkedAccount: your-linked-account-name
```

#### `trustedAccountKey` (optional)

Only required if your New Relic account is a sub-account. This needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account.

```yaml
custom:
  newRelic:
    trustedAccountKey: your-parent-account-id
```

#### `debug` (optional)

Whether or not to enable debug mode. Must be a boolean value. This sets the log level to
debug.

```yaml
custom:
  newRelic:
    debug: true
```

#### `enableExtension` (optional)

Allows your function to deliver its telemetry to New Relic via AWS Lambda Extension. Defaults to `true`, so it can be omitted. To avoid delivering your telemetry via the extension, set to `false`.

```yaml
custom:
  newRelic:
    enableExtension: true
```
#### `enableFunctionLogs` (optional)

Allows your function to deliver all of your function logs to New Relic via AWS Lambda Extension. This would eliminate the need for a CloudWatch log subscription + the NR log ingestion Lambda function. This method of log ingestion is lower-cost, and offers faster time to glass.  

```yaml
custom:
  newRelic:
    enableFunctionLogs: true
```

#### `enableExtensionLogs` (optional)

The New Relic Lambda Extension writes diagnostic logs by default. If you'd prefer to mute them, set this to `false`. (Defaults to `true`.) 

```yaml
custom:
  newRelic:
    enableExtensionLogs: false
```

#### `logEnabled` (optional)

Enables logging when using CloudWatch-based telemetry transport with the newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda function. Defaults to `false`


#### `enableIntegration` (optional)

Allows the creation of New Relic aws cloud integration when absent. Defaults to `false`. If an integration already exists for your AWS account,you can omit this. 

```yaml
custom:
  newRelic:
    enableIntegration: true
```

#### `logLevel` (optional)

Sets a log level on all functions. Possible values: `'fatal'`, `'error'`, `'warn'`, `'info'`, `'debug'`, `'trace'` or `'silent'`. Defaults to `'error'`

You can still override log level on a per function basis by configuring environment variable `NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL`.

```yaml
custom:
  newRelic:
    logLevel: debug
```

Logging configuration is considered in the following order:

1. function `NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL` environment
2. provider `NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL` environment
3. custom newRelic `logLevel` property
4. custom newRelic `debug` flag


#### `manualWrapping` (optional)

Functions with many dependencies may experience longer cold start times with dynamic wrapping. One possible remediation is to [wrap the function manually](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/enable-serverless-monitoring-aws-lambda-legacy/#node), and bypass the no-code-change wrapping. If you enable this option, you'll need to `require` (or, for ESM, `import`) the New Relic Node Agent, and wrap the body of your handler function. You would still be able to take advantage of the easy installation of the agent via Lambda Layers, and still have telemetry transported to New Relic via the Lambda Extension. We recommend that you include the New Relic Node Agent as a devDependency for local development, and omit it from the dependencies you deploy.  Defaults to `false`. 

```yaml
custom:
  newRelic:
    manualWrapping: true
```

#### `customRolePolicy` (optional)

Specify an alternative IAM role policy ARN for this integration here if you do not want to use the default role policy.

```yaml
custom:
  newRelic:
    customRolePolicy: your-custom-role-policy-arn
```

#### `stages` (optional)

An array of stages that the plugin will be included for. If this key is not specified then all stages will be included.

```yaml
custom:
  newRelic:
    stages:
       - prod
```

#### `include` (optional)

An array of functions to include for automatic wrapping. (You can set `include` or `exclude` options, but not both.)

```yaml
custom:
  newRelic:
    include:
      - include-only-func
      - another-included-func
```

#### `exclude` (optional)

An array of functions to exclude from automatic wrapping. (You can set `include` or `exclude` options, but not both.)

```yaml
custom:
  newRelic:
    exclude:
      - excluded-func-1
      - another-excluded-func
```

#### `layerArn` (optional)

Pin to a specific layer version. The latest layer ARN is automatically fetched from the [New Relic Layers API](https://layers.newrelic-external.com)

```yaml
custom:
  newRelic:
    layerArn: arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:451483290750:layer:NewRelicPython37:2
```

#### `cloudWatchFilter` (optional)

Provide a list of quoted filter terms for the CloudWatch log subscription to the newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda. Combines all terms into an OR filter. Defaults to "NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING" if not set. Use "\*" to capture all logs

```yaml
custom:
  newRelic:
    cloudWatchFilter:
      - "NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING"
      - "trace this"
      - "ERROR"
```

If you want to collect all logs:

```yaml
custom:
  newRelic:
    cloudWatchFilter: "*"
```

Be sure to set the `LOGGING_ENABLED` environment variable to `true` in your log
ingestion function. See the [aws-log-ingestion documentation](https://github.com/newrelic/aws-log-ingestion) for details.

#### `prepend` (optional)

Whether or not to prepend the New Relic layer. Defaults to `false` which appends the layer.

```yaml
custom:
  newRelic:
    prepend: true
```

#### `logIngestionFunctionName` (optional)

Only required if your New Relic log ingestion function name is different from `newrelic-log-ingestion`.

```yaml
custom:
  newRelic:
    logIngestionFunctionName: log-ingestion-service
```

#### `disableAutoSubscription` (optional)

Only required if you want to disable auto subscription.

```yaml
custom:
  newRelic:
    disableAutoSubscription: true
```

#### `disableLicenseKeySecret` (optional)

Only required if you want to disable creating license key in AWS Secrets Manager. Setting this as `true` would create NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY environment variable for the New Relic Lambda Extension to access.

```yaml
custom:
  newRelic:
    disableLicenseKeySecret: true
```
#### `enableDistributedTracing` (optional)

Only required if you want to disable distributed tracing.

```yaml
custom:
  newRelic:
     enableDistributedTracing: false
```
#### `javaNewRelicHandler` (optional)

**Java runtimes only**. Only required if you are implementing the `RequestStreamHandler` interface.
Defaults to `RequestHandler` interface.
#### Accepted inputs:
- handleRequest
- handleStreamsRequest

```yaml
custom:
  newRelic:
    javaNewRelicHandler: handleStreamsRequest
```

#### `proxy` (optional)

This plugin makes various HTTP requests to public APIs in order to retrieve data about the New Relic and cloud provider accounts. If you are behind a proxy when this plugin runs, the HTTP agent needs the proxy information to connect to those APIs. Use the given URL as a proxy for HTTP requests.

```yaml
custom:
  newRelic:
    proxy: http://yourproxy.com:8080
```
